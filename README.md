Manage your servers through ssh via web interface.
Start by pressing an 'Projects' button or a 'Projects' link at the top.
Select project by clicking on it. Or create a new one via 'Add new project' link.
In the project section navigate using tabs: 'Main', 'Cron Jobs' and 'History'.

On the 'Cron Jobs' tab you can view cron jobs scheduled for this project.
You can select them via click or by pressing 'Select All Jobs' button.
